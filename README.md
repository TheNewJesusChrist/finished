## 🧩 The Problem We’re Solving

Students often have:
- Static, boring lecture slides
- No quick way to test their understanding
- Little motivation to self-assess

**Solution:**
- Let them upload course materials
- Use AI to generate a quiz from the content
- Make it fun with ranks, streaks, and a Star Wars theme

## 💡 Business Model (Optional/Future Scope)

This could become a gamified learning platform:
- Subscription for advanced analytics and progress tracking
- Premium ranks/themes
- Institutional partnerships for quiz-based certification

## 👾 How Quiz Generation Works

When a user uploads a PDF or PPT:
- The file is sent to Supabase Storage
- OpenRouter (powered by AI models like GPT-4) reads and analyzes the document
- It returns multiple-choice questions based **specifically** on the content
- These are rendered as an interactive quiz to test understanding
